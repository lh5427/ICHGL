ICHGL: Intent-Consistent Hierarchical Graph Learning
====================================================

This file implements the main ICHGL model proposed in:

"Intent-Consistent Hierarchical Graph Learning with Cross-Behavior Transfer
for Multi-Behavior Recommendation"


Modules implemented:
- Unified Graph Embedding
- Behavior-Specific Graph Embedding
- Auxiliary Intent Subgraph Embedding
- Target Intent-Aware Denoising Encoder
- Mutual Information Regularization
- Cross-Behavior Personalized Transfer

Release Note:
- Code released after paper acceptance.
- Please cite the above paper if you use this implementation.
